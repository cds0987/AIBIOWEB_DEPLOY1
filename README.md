Key Components

AI_Model/: Hosts all AI-related models, training scripts, and pre-trained weights.

Data/: Centralized location for raw data, processed data, and data transformation tools.

ResearchFeatures/: Dedicated space for testing experimental AI features.

static/: Stores all static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files used in the front-end.

templates/: Houses the HTML templates used for rendering web pages.

UserTracking/: Implements user activity tracking and analytics for insights.

utils/: Utility scripts to support various components of the application.

Webapp/: The primary logic and structure of the web application.

Supporting Directories

app/: Main application entry point to launch the website.

BioApp/: Specialized modules and tools for biological data processing and visualization.

config/: Configuration settings for database, API keys, and environment variables.

Deployment/: Resources for deploying the application to production, such as Docker, Kubernetes, or CI/CD pipelines.

Report/: Contains project reports, research findings, and associated documentation.

requirements/: Lists all Python dependencies required for running the application.

run/: Scripts for starting, testing, and maintaining the application.
